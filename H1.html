          <p class="card-text" style="color: beige;">Embarking on my HTML journey has been both exciting and enlightening. What started as a curiosity about web design soon transformed into a passion for crafting digital experiences. Learning HTML introduced me to the foundational elements of web development, from structuring content with tags to styling pages with CSS. Each line of code was a step towards understanding how the web functions, and every project—no matter how small—was a chance to apply what I’d learned. As I continue to explore advanced techniques and integrate new technologies, I appreciate how HTML serves as the backbone of web creation, enabling me to build engaging and interactive websites. This journey has not only expanded my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for the art and science of web development.</p>

          <p class="card-text" style="color: beige;">Embarking on my GitHub journey has been a pivotal experience in my development career. Initially, GitHub seemed like just a platform for version control, but it quickly became a powerful tool for collaboration and project management. Learning to use Git and GitHub transformed how I approach coding—understanding branching, commits, and pull requests revolutionized my workflow. Contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with others has not only enhanced my coding skills but also introduced me to a vibrant community of developers. GitHub has become an essential part of my toolkit, helping me manage projects efficiently, track progress, and engage with the broader tech community. As I continue to grow, GitHub remains a cornerstone of my development practices and a testament to the power of collaborative coding.
